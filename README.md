# FINDINGS
From our analysis we found out that:
  Most played: The total number of artists on spotify is 4112, there were 7905 albums and 16.67K tracks on the website between 2013 and 2024. The total streaming time on the website was 320.49K minutes.
    93% of the streaming was from android platforms.
  Listening behaviour : A higher percentage of tracks ie 74% were shuffled.
    Most of the tracks were not skipped ie only 5% of the tracks were skipped.This suggests that most playlists were satisfactory to the listeners.
    Most of the streaming was done between midday and 7:00 PM with the highest streaming hour being 12:00 PM. This houes are more associated with leisure.
  Listening trends: The top streamed artist are the beatles, the highest streamed album was The New Abnormal and the most streamed song was Ode To The Mets.
    The highest cause for music ending was clickrow followed by hitting the next button.This suggests that most playlists were individually suited to indivudual needs.
    The day of the week with the highest streaming was Friday while the mnth with the highest stteaming was October. This suggests that streaming was mostly done during leisure time.
    More minutes of a song played when the reason a track started playing was that a previous track was done. This increased a tracks playtime by 2.25 minutes.

# RECOMENDATIONS
From our visualizations, its clear that the website has a great system where music playlists are suited to individuals. Maintaining and improving this system would help increase streaming.
To increase streaming, tracks more suited for relaxation could be increased on the website. This could increase steaming during the night hours.
There should be an upgrade on the website to avoid track erro as the reason for music stopping.
